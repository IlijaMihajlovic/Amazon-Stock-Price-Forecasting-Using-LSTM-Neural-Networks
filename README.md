This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast Amazon stock prices. 
The project uses historical stock price data from AMZN.csv to train an LSTM model for time series forecasting.
___

## Key Features
- Data Preparation: The notebook loads and preprocesses Amazon stock price data, focusing on closing prices over time.
- Feature Engineering: Creates time-lagged features to help the model learn temporal patterns.
- Data Normalization: Uses MinMaxScaler to scale data between -1 and 1 for better model performance.
- LSTM Model: Implements a custom LSTM architecture with PyTorch for sequence prediction.
- Training Pipeline: Includes data loading, model training, and validation processes.
- Time Series Forecasting: Demonstrates how to use the trained model for stock price prediction.
___

## Technical Details
- Layers: 1 LSTM layer with 4 hidden units followed by a fully connected layer
- Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Optimizer: Adam with learning rate 0.001
- Batch Size: 16
- Lookback Window: 7 days (using past 7 days to predict next day)
- The `AMZN.csv` dataset is included in the repository
___

    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_stacked_layers):
        super().__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.num_stacked_layers = num_stacked_layers

        # LSTM layer
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_stacked_layers, 
                           batch_first=True)

        # Initialize hidden state and cell state
        h0 = torch.zeros(self.num_stacked_layers, batch_size, self.hidden_size).to(x.device)
        c0 = torch.zeros(self.num_stacked_layers, batch_size, self.hidden_size).to(x.device)
        
        # Forward pass through LSTM
        out, _ = self.lstm(x, (h0, c0))
        
        # Only take the output from the final timestep
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return out

## Data Preprocessing 

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

def prepare_dataframe_for_lstm(df, n_steps):
    """
    Prepare time series data for LSTM training by creating lag features

    df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

    # Create lag features
    for i in range(1, n_steps + 1):
        df[f'Close(t-{i})'] = df['Close'].shift(i)
    
    df.dropna(inplace=True)
    
    # Normalize data between -1 and 1
    scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(-1, 1))
    scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df)
    
    return pd.DataFrame(scaled_data, columns=df.columns), scaler

        lookback: Number of timesteps to look back
    
    Returns:
        X: Input sequences (n_samples, lookback, n_features)
        y: Target values
    """
    X = data[:, 1:]  # All columns except target
    y = data[:, 0]   # Target column (Close price)
    
    # Flip to have most recent timesteps last
    X = np.flip(X, axis=1)
    
    # Reshape for LSTM [samples, timesteps, features]
    X = X.reshape((-1, lookback, 1))
    y = y.reshape((-1, 1))

## Long-Term Trend
*Long-term trend prediction of Amazon stock price.*
- Scale: The y-axis ranges from -1.0 to -0.2, representing normalized closing prices.
- Trend: The plot spans ~5000 days (historical data), showing how well the model captures long-term trends.
- Alignment: The predicted values (orange/red line) closely follow the actual closing prices (blue line), indicating the model learns temporal patterns effectively.
- Volatility: Some deviations occur during market fluctuations, suggesting the model may struggle with abrupt changes.

___

  ## Short-Term Focus
  *Short-term zoom showing prediction accuracy over 300 days.*
- Scale: The y-axis ranges from 0.0 to 0.8 (normalized), zooming into a 300-day window.
- Precision: Predictions (orange/red) align closely with actual prices (blue), especially in stable periods.
- Lag Effect: Minor delays in predictions during sharp price changes hint at the LSTMâ€™s tendency to "smooth" volatile movements
